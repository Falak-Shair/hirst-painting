# hirst-painting
Using this project I looked deeper into turtle graphics, starting to do things with graphics, with the help of the turtle module.

And I also have learned about Python tuples as well as looking deeper into importing modules in Python.

I have written some code that is capable of generating million dollar pieces of odd work. I am looking at a Damien Hirst, which sold for 1.275

million pounds a little while ago.

And we're going to be using Python turtle to create a similarly beautiful dot spot painting, which could be randomized and create beautiful pieces of art
